# Simon-Game

Created as part of the Free Code Camp frontend curriculum in order to mimic the classic game of Simon. Try to remember and replicate the pattern of flashing lights by clicking on the correct colors.
Don't worry if you mess up. Unless you are playing in strict mode the computer will remind you of the pattern and you won't have to start over.
Successfully repeat a pattern of 20 and you win!
